# C6-1.47-LCD-MicroPython-display-lib
A MicroPython lib file for the Waveshare ESP32 C6 1.47" LCD controller/display board

Runs as a main file or include. Ported from a waveshare wiki example file running a similar external display through a pico. For an idiot like me, not having a micropython lib already listed or named anywhere for this contraption was driving me nuts, maybe this saves someone else the headache.
